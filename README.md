# CatchBackdoor: Backdoor Testing via Critical Trojan Neural Path Fuzzing

# Setup
The code should be run using python 3.6.0, Tensorflow-gpu 2.4.0, Keras 2.4.3, Foolbox 2.3.0, PIL, h5py, and adversarial-robustness-toolbox

# Datasets & Models

Here, we give LeNet-5 trained under MNIST as a example.

# How to train a trojaned model
  ```python
 python cifar_model.py
  ```


# Note
See the paper CatchBackdoor: Backdoor Testing via Critical Trojan Neural Path Fuzzing for more details.
